Stage 2 report

1) The function merge.s merges 2 string lists, using the function compare.s I had written for stage 1.

Design decisions:
@r0 has pointer to 1st list of strings
@r1 has pointer to 2nd list of strings
@r2 has comparison mode - 0 if case-insensitive, 1 means case-sensitive.
@r3,r12 will be used to maintain i,j where i is number of strings processed in list 1, j is the number of strings processed in list 2.-caller needs to store them
@r4 has number of strings in 1st list
@r5 has number of strings in 2nd list
@r6 has duplicate removal option - 0 if duplicates not to be removed, 1 if duplicates are to be removed.
@r0 has the final merged list
@r1 has the final length of the merged list
